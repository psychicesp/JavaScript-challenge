This was a quick and simple project to show a filterable table in a website.

The website can be viewed [here](psychicesp.github.io/JavaScript-challenge)

The data provided dealt with UFO sightings and is in static/js/data.js

All data will be displayed by default.  When the 'Filter Table' button is pressed, it will rebuild the table based on the entered information.
